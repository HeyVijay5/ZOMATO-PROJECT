        "The food delivery and restaurant discovery industry has witnessed rapid growth due to increasing urbanization and changing consumer preferences. Platforms like Zomato generate large volumes of data in the form of restaurant metadata and customer reviews, which can be effectively analyzed to extract valuable insights. This project aims to perform a comprehensive data science analysis on Zomato restaurant and review data to understand customer sentiment, restaurant performance, and emerging patterns using machine learning techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project consists of two primary components. The first dataset contains restaurant-level metadata such as restaurant names, cost information, cuisines offered, collections, and operational details. The second dataset comprises customer review data, including reviewer details, textual reviews, ratings, and timestamps. These datasets together provide a holistic view of both restaurant characteristics and customer perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, quality, and distribution of data. Key statistical summaries and visualizations are used to analyze rating distributions, cost patterns, and review characteristics. Missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates are identified during this phase, enabling informed decisions during data cleaning. EDA helps in uncovering initial trends such as the relationship between restaurant cost and customer ratings, as well as identifying commonly preferred cuisines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data cleaning and preprocessing form a critical part of the workflow. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing restaurant names, and cleaning textual review data by eliminating noise such as special characters and unnecessary symbols. Feature engineering techniques are applied to derive meaningful attributes from the raw data, including sentiment labels derived from ratings and numerical features representing review characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is a core component of this project. Customer ratings are converted into four sentiment categories: Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, and Negative. A supervised machine learning classification model is trained using review text as input features and sentiment labels as the target variable. Text vectorization techniques are applied to convert unstructured text into numerical representations suitable for model training. The performance of the classification model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to sentiment classification, unsupervised learning techniques are employed to cluster restaurants based on their attributes such as cost, cuisine diversity, and aggregated sentiment scores. Clustering enables the identification of distinct groups of restaurants with similar characteristics, helping in understanding market segmentation and competitive positioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final phase of the project focuses on the visualization and interpretation of results. Insights derived from the analysis are presented using meaningful visualizations that highlight customer preferences, high-performing restaurants, and areas requiring improvement. These insights can be valuable for customers seeking better dining options, restaurant owners aiming to improve service quality, and platform providers looking to enhance recommendation systems.\n"

Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of both restaurant characteristics and customer perceptions.\n",

Recall was crucial to capture as many true negative reviews as possible, enabling timely corrective actions and customer experience improvements. F1-score, which balances precision and recall, was considered the most business-relevant metric because it ensures fair performance across all sentiment classes, leading to more reliable insights for decision-making, restaurant ranking, and customer satisfaction strategies."

        "Performance Level: Both models achieve scores consistently in the 0.85 to 0.90 range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Balance: There is almost no \"gap\" between Precision and Recall in these models. This indicates that the models are equally good at identifying positive cases (Recall) and ensuring that those identifications are correct (Precision).\n",

        "Performance Level: It maintains a steady score of approximately 0.80.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observation: There is a slight visible edge in Precision compared to its Accuracy and Recall. This suggests the model is slightly more conservative; when it predicts a category, it is often right, but it might miss a few more cases compared to SVM or Logistic Regression.\n",

        "Project Report Inferences\n",
        "Overall Model Efficacy\n",
        "The project has successfully developed classification models with high predictive power. Since all models score above 0.80, the features selected for training (likely derived from text tokenization and NLTK processing) are highly representative of the target labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection\n",
        "Best Candidates: For deployment, Logistic Regression or SVM should be preferred over Multinomial Naive Bayes, as they provide an approximate 8−10% improvement in overall accuracy and error reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistency: The \"flatness\" of the bars in the Logistic Regression and SVM charts indicates that the dataset is likely well-balanced. If the dataset were highly imbalanced, we would typically see a significant drop in either Precision or Recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Conclusion\n",
        "The high F1-Scores across the board indicate that the preprocessing pipeline (Tokenization, cleaning, and vectorization) was effective. The similarity between SVM and Logistic Regression suggests that the decision boundary for this data is likely linear or easily separable in higher dimensions."

Given the imbalanced nature of sentiment classes, F1-score was prioritized, making Logistic Regression the most reliable and balanced model for this task.

        "This project successfully implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for restaurant sentiment analysis using Zomato customer review data, with a clear focus on extracting actionable insights for both customers and businesses. Through detailed exploratory data analysis, the project identified key behavioral patterns such as the dominance of positive customer reviews, the measurable impact of customer engagement (pictures uploaded and review depth) on sentiment, and the strong relationship between rating consistency and overall customer satisfaction. These findings validated the project’s objective of helping customers identify the best-performing restaurants while enabling companies to recognize operational gaps.\n",

        "Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to ensure analytical robustness. This included missing value imputation, IQR-based outlier treatment, categorical encoding, and an extensive NLP pipeline involving text normalization, tokenization, lemmatization, and TF–IDF vectorization. The TF–IDF feature space, combined with dimensionality reduction and feature selection, effectively captured sentiment-bearing terms while maintaining computational efficiency. Class imbalance was successfully addressed using SMOTE, ensuring that negative and neutral sentiments were learned fairly alongside the dominant positive class.\n",

        "Multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multinomial Naive Bayes—were trained and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score as primary metrics. Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.89 and an F1-score close to 0.89, outperforming SVM and Naive Bayes in both stability and class-wise balance. Its superior performance, combined with high interpretability, made it the most suitable model for this sentiment classification task. Coefficient-based explainability further enabled identification of key positive and negative sentiment-driving terms, translating model predictions into meaningful business insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced analytical extensions such as cost–benefit analysis, restaurant segmentation, and critic identification provided additional value. The analysis revealed that higher cost does not necessarily guarantee higher satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of service quality and consistency. Influential reviewers were identified using engagement metadata, offering the platform an opportunity to monitor sentiment leaders and improve trust-based ranking mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the Logistic Regression model was saved, reloaded, and validated on unseen data, confirming deployment readiness and reproducibility. Overall, this project successfully met all defined objectives, delivering a production-ready, interpretable, and business-relevant sentiment analysis system. The insights generated can support better restaurant recommendations, pricing strategies, customer experience optimization, and informed decision-making, demonstrating a professionally executed and academically sound machine learning capstone project."
